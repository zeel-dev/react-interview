# Zeel Interview Test

## 1 - UI Breakdown

For that part, we'll analyse the design of an app, and I want you to break it down for me. Simply walk me through what you can extract from that UI, and what is your thought-process before coding it:

e.g:
- How would you break it down into components
- What is the data-flow (do we need a data-store?)


## 2 - Fetch data and display in component

Running the app and server, you can hit http://localhost:8099/users to fetch users. Fetch the data in the Home page, and display the users.


## 3 - Fixing and giving feedback to coworker about his /coworker page

Look at the page your coworker built. There are a lot of issues. 
Imagine I am the teammate that wrote this, show me how youâ€™d give me feedback on what I did wrong (almost as if it was a PR, or he was coming to you to get your opinion).

Then, fix all the issues.


## Run the project

Make sure you have node 12+ installed

`npm i && npm start`


## Endpoints

- http://localhost:8099/users
