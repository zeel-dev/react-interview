# Zeel Interview Test

## 1 - UI Breakdown

For that part, we'll analyse the design of an app, and I want you to break it down for me. Simply walk me through what you can extract from that UI, and what is your thought-process before coding it:

e.g:
- How would you break it down into components
- What is the data-flow (do we need a data-store?)


## 2 - Build the UI

Now that we broke it down, let's start building it. Imagine the scenario where the code was already started by another dev, and you take over and continue where he left off.

* No prior decisions are final, so you're free to take any decisions to improve the codebase.

1 - reviewing the existing code
2 - creating the "users" page structure
3 - create an input component
4 - fetch users from api and filter using input


## Run the project

Make sure you have node 12+ installed

`npm i && npm start`


## Endpoints

- http://localhost:8099/users
